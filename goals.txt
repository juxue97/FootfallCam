 - Vision - 
1. Identify which frames in the clip have the staff present?
2. [Bonus] Locate the staff xy coordinates when present in the clip.

 - Mission / Milestones - 
1. ScreenTracking (done)
    1.1 Draw a boundary line on the corridor (decision boundary, line_y) (done)
    1.2 Consider a ROI where those object within that defined region will be detected (done) 
        - img cropping for roi image = image[height,width]
        - Up Dir => enter
        - Down Dir => exit

2. Object Detect (Ultralytic YOLO-V8)
    - enter => count +1, exit => count -1
    condition : 
    if curr_obj_y < line_y - offset & flag == out:
        counter +1
        flag=in
    elif curr_obj_y > line_y + offset & flag == in:
        counter-1
        flag=out

    2.1 Counter without tag, assume not worker right now (counter changed as they crossed the decision boundary)
    2.2 Counter with tag, there is a worker with the tag (counter not affected)
    
    2.3 Training Process ******* Do this first tomorrow ********
        -   take screenshots from the videos
        -   perform data augmentation if needed
        -   image segmentation (labelling)

3. More to go?
    - report


Things to consider:
a. performance (fps) - main fps, ss fps,model fps
b. accuracy, fp (we do not wan to miss anything moving in/out)

c. low cost, easy to manage, smooth run
    (use opencv haar cascade model for tag)
    (use pretrained yolo model for detecting human)
    *crop roi
    *gaussian blur
    *grayscale
